# Project Synopsis
This is a tabular remake of the song Through the Fire and Flames (by Dragon Force) in a Scratch project called Guitar Tab Creator and Player.

## Better Description
The text file in the repo is a code that, when entered into the project's 'Load Tab' function, will display the tabs in the formation similar to the song so when played, it sounds like the song. A limitation is that the project only uses a guitar, so I'll have to get creative with how to make different sounds.
